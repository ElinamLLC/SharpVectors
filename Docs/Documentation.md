## Introduction
The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a well-known graphics format developed and maintained by the W3C SVG Working Group. The SVG is designed to be used on the web, but format is flexible enough to applications outside the web.
SVG is a markup language for describing two-dimensional graphics applications and images, and a set of related graphics script interfaces.

The SVG#-Reloaded project aims to provide libraries and tools to parse, convert and view the SVG on Windows, especially on the Windows Presentation Foundation platform.
