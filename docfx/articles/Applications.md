## 4 Applications
The SVG# Reloaded comes with one main end-user application, an SVG Viewer or Browser. The viewer is named Squiggle.NET or simply Squiggle, after a similar viewer in the [Batik SVG Toolkit](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/) (since the target is to produce something similar to the [Batik Squiggle](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/browser.html)).
